## Scheme 1: Golden Voice Key (金色声纹钥匙)

### Simple Prompt

macOS app icon, a minimalist key silhouette where the key teeth are formed by audio waveform lines, the key bow (head) contains a circular microphone symbol, amber gold color (#D97706, #F59E0B) on a near-black background (#09090B), subtle gold glow, flat design with slight skeuomorphic sheen, rounded square canvas, Big Sur style, clean and sharp lines, 1:1 ratio

### Detailed Prompt

**Subject & Composition:**
A single minimalist key centered on a macOS-style rounded square canvas (1:1 aspect ratio). The key shaft and teeth are replaced by precise audio waveform bars — varying heights arranged rhythmically like an equalizer, suggesting sound. The key's bow (circular head) frames a clean circular microphone grill pattern, rendered with subtle mesh detail. The overall silhouette is immediately recognizable as a key yet communicates voice/audio.

**Color & Material:**
Primary key body in warm amber gold (#D97706) with highlights reaching bright amber (#F59E0B). The key surface carries a soft metallic sheen — not fully flat, not fully 3D — evoking quality without being heavy. A diffuse golden glow radiates from the key onto the background, giving it presence and warmth. Background: deep charcoal black (#09090B to #18181B radial gradient), understated and premium.

**Lighting & Atmosphere:**
Soft top-left directional light source creating gentle specular highlights on the waveform teeth. The microphone head has a subtle inner glow as if active. Gold halo ring around the full icon adds brand identity.

**Style:**
Flat-plus-micro-skeuomorphic hybrid, fine line weight (~1.5–2px), Apple macOS Big Sur rounded corner squircle. No drop shadow. Crisp at all sizes (16px to 512px).

**Midjourney:** `--ar 1:1 --style raw --stylize 200 --v 6`

**Keywords:** macOS Big Sur icon style, flat design, micro skeuomorphism, amber gold, dark theme, premium minimal, SF Symbols aesthetic, clean geometric

## Scheme 2: Sonic Ripple (声波涟漪)

### Simple Prompt

macOS app icon, top-down view of a glowing amber microphone icon at center, surrounded by concentric circular sound ripples that gradually dissolve into tiny text/letter particles at the edges, amber gold (#F59E0B) to dark amber (#92400E) radial gradient ripples, deep black background (#09090B), ultra-minimal modern style, depth and glow, Siri-wave inspired, 1:1 square canvas

### Detailed Prompt

**Subject & Composition:**
A bird's-eye (top-down orthographic) view composition. A compact, elegant microphone icon sits at the exact center — a simple capsule mic head with thin stand — rendered in bright amber gold (#F59E0B). From it, five to seven concentric circular ripple rings expand outward at even intervals, like a sound wave or water ripple. The inner rings are solid gold lines; as they expand outward they become thinner and more transparent, with tiny glowing typographic characters (letters, punctuation fragments) beginning to emerge from the outermost rings, symbolizing the transformation of voice into text.

**Color & Material:**
Center microphone: vivid amber (#F59E0B) with a soft luminous core glow, as if powered on. Ripple rings gradient from amber gold (#D97706) to deep amber-brown (#92400E) as they expand, fading in opacity. Background: flat deep black (#09090B), no texture — the glow effect provides all the visual interest. Particle text characters near edges are near-white with golden tint, very small (suggestive, not readable).

**Lighting & Atmosphere:**
The microphone functions as a light source, emitting warm amber light outward. No external light source. The radial glow creates a sense of depth and dimensional space on a 2D canvas. Outer edges of the icon canvas have slight vignette to focus attention center.

**Style:**
Ultra-minimalist, geometric precision, contemporary tech aesthetic. Inspired by Siri's sound visualization but more restrained and icon-appropriate.

**Midjourney:** `--ar 1:1 --style raw --stylize 300 --v 6`

**Keywords:** minimal tech icon, Siri ripple wave, concentric circles, voice to text visualization, glowing microphone, particle typography, amber glow, dark UI, macOS menu bar app aesthetic

## Scheme 3: V-Mic (V字麦克风)

### Simple Prompt

macOS app icon, bold letter V shape where both arms of the V are constructed from audio frequency spectrum bars (equalizer lines), the bottom vertex of the V merges into a circular microphone grille head, amber gold gradient (#D97706 to #F59E0B), dark matte background (#18181B) with subtle noise texture, geometric logo style, strong at small sizes, 1:1 square canvas

### Detailed Prompt

**Subject & Composition:**
A strong, geometric letterform-based composition. The letter V dominates the icon, centered on a macOS squircle canvas. Each arm of the V is not a solid line but is built from a series of vertical frequency-spectrum bars of varying heights — like an audio equalizer visualization — arranged along the diagonal axes of the V shape. At the bottom vertex where the two arms converge, the bars flow naturally into a circular microphone capsule head: a hemisphere with a fine mesh grille pattern (6×6 circular grid), completing the V-to-mic transformation. The negative space inside the V is intentionally open, giving the icon a confident, airy structure.

**Color & Material:**
Amber gold gradient applied along the V from top to bottom: arm tops begin at rich amber (#D97706), transitioning to bright gold (#F59E0B) toward the mic head vertex, giving visual weight at the focal point. The microphone grille uses a slightly darker amber shade (#B45309) with specular mesh highlights. Background: very dark neutral (#18181B) with an extremely subtle grain/noise texture (5% opacity).

**Style:**
Strong logo-grade geometric construction. Works at 16px (menu bar) through 512px (App Store). Influenced by modern wordmark logo design and SF Symbols geometric discipline.

**Midjourney:** `--ar 1:1 --style raw --stylize 250 --v 6`

**Keywords:** geometric logo icon, letterform V, audio equalizer bars, microphone grille, amber gold gradient, dark matte background, macOS app icon, bold minimal, scalable design, monogram style

## Scheme 4: Speech Bubble Cursor (对话气泡 × 光标)

### Simple Prompt

macOS app icon, rounded speech bubble with frosted glass dark surface (#27272A), a single blinking text cursor (vertical line) glowing amber (#D97706, #F59E0B) centered inside the bubble, 2–3 soft arc soundwave lines radiating from the bubble's outer edge in amber gold, deep black background (#09090B), subtle depth shadow under the bubble, clean minimalist composition, soft glow bloom, --ar 1:1 --style raw --q 2

### Detailed Prompt

**Subject & Composition:**
A single rounded-rectangle speech bubble centered on a deep black canvas (#09090B). The bubble occupies roughly 60% of the icon area. Its tail points downward-left, suggesting spoken output. Inside the bubble, a slim vertical text cursor (I-beam line) is rendered with an amber-gold glow, as if actively blinking. Along the outside upper-right arc of the bubble, 2–3 concentric arc lines represent soundwaves — thin, elegant, spaced progressively wider.

**Material & Texture:**
The bubble surface has a frosted glass (glassmorphism) quality: semi-transparent dark zinc (#27272A at ~85% opacity), with a very faint inner highlight on the top edge suggesting glass refraction. The bubble has a 1px luminous amber border (#D97706 at 40% opacity).

**Color & Lighting:**
- Background: near-black (#09090B)
- Bubble body: dark frosted zinc (#27272A)
- Cursor & soundwaves: amber gold (#D97706 core, #F59E0B outer glow)
- Glow bloom radius: moderate, soft, not harsh
- Subtle drop shadow beneath the bubble for lift

**Style & Mood:**
macOS native aesthetic, frosted-glass skeuomorphism meets flat minimalism. References: Apple's iMessage dark icon, macOS Monterey frosted panels.

**Midjourney:** `--ar 1:1 --style raw --q 2 --v 6`

**Keywords:** glassmorphism, frosted glass, dark mode, amber glow, macOS icon, soundwave, minimalist, speech bubble, cursor blink, glow bloom

## Scheme 5: Waveform Letters (音频波形字母)

### Simple Prompt

macOS app icon, bold letter "V" and "K" overlapping/intertwined, strokes built from vertical audio spectrum bars (equalizer columns), bars gradient from deep amber (#92400E) at the base to bright gold (#F59E0B) at the top, pure black background (#09090B), dynamic rhythm, sleek tech aesthetic, sharp edges, subtle specular reflection on bar tops, centered composition, --ar 1:1 --style raw --q 2

### Detailed Prompt

**Subject & Composition:**
The letters "V" and "K" are merged into a single unified glyph occupying the center 70% of the icon. The letterforms are not drawn with solid strokes but are instead constructed entirely from vertical equalizer/spectrum bars — like a music visualizer frozen in motion. The bars vary in height according to a natural audio curve.

**Letter Geometry:**
- "V": two diagonal legs descending to a sharp center point; bars fill each diagonal arm.
- "K": vertical spine on the left, two diagonal arms reaching right; bars fill the spine and arms.
- The letters share a common vertical axis — the right leg of "V" merges visually with the spine of "K".

**Color & Gradient:**
Each bar uses a vertical gradient: Bottom deep burnt amber (#92400E) → Mid warm amber (#D97706) → Top bright golden yellow (#F59E0B) with a subtle specular highlight (near-white tip). Background is pure near-black (#09090B).

**Style & Mood:**
Dynamic, modern, tech-forward. References: Spotify's audio visualizer aesthetics, Ableton Live spectrum display.

## Scheme 7: Option Key Wave (Option 键 + 声波)

### Simple Prompt

App icon for macOS menu bar app, 1024x1024px, square canvas with rounded corners (Apple icon mask), high-fidelity digital illustration, ultra-sharp detail, production-ready. The macOS Option key symbol (⌥) centered on a near-black background (#0A0A0C) with a subtle radial gradient. The symbol rendered in amber-gold metallic material (#D97706 with metallic sheen and specular highlights), its line terminals softly glowing. Concentric sound wave arcs radiate outward from the symbol in translucent light gold (#F59E0B at 40% opacity). Minimal, restrained, native macOS aesthetic. --ar 1:1 --style raw

### Detailed Prompt

**Composition:** The macOS Option key glyph (⌥) is precisely centered at 55% of icon width. It sits within a deep near-black background (#0A0A0C) that transitions via a very subtle radial gradient to (#111113) at the edges. Three to four concentric sound-wave arcs radiate outward from the glyph, evenly spaced, each arc slightly thinner and more transparent as it expands.

**Primary element:** The ⌥ symbol is drawn with clean, geometric strokes rendered in brushed amber-gold metal (#D97706). The metallic surface shows a soft specular highlight along the upper-left edge (as if lit from top-left at 45°), transitioning to a warmer, slightly darker gold (#B45309) on shadow faces. Each stroke terminal — especially the three tips of the glyph — emits a soft diffused amber glow (radius ~8% of icon), suggesting activation energy.

**Sound waves:** The radiating arcs are rendered as fine hairlines in translucent light amber (#F59E0B, 40% opacity for innermost, fading to 15% opacity for outermost). Stroke weight tapers from 2px inner to 0.5px outer. The arcs have a very slight organic wobble — not perfectly circular — to feel acoustic rather than mechanical.

**Background:** Deep matte black (#0A0A0C) with an extremely subtle vignette. No texture, no grain. Clean and modern.

**Mood:** Minimalist, precise, macOS-native in spirit — like a refined SF Symbols icon elevated to hero art. Quiet confidence.

**Midjourney:** `--ar 1:1 --style raw --stylize 200 --v 6.1`

**Keywords:** minimalist icon design, SF Symbols aesthetic, metallic amber gold, macOS Big Sur icon style, option key glyph, sound wave arcs, dark background icon, specular metallic material, glowing terminals, restrained luxury

## Scheme 8: Voice Unlock (声音解锁)

### Simple Prompt

App icon for macOS menu bar app, 1024x1024px, square canvas with rounded corners (Apple icon mask), high-fidelity digital illustration, ultra-sharp detail, production-ready. A padlock rendered in brushed dark metal (#27272A), its shackle slightly open, keyhole replaced by a fine microphone mesh grille texture. From the crack of the opening lock spills warm volumetric amber-gold light (#D97706 to #F59E0B), with hairline sound wave ripples riding the glow. Deep black background (#09090B). Skeuomorphic craftsmanship meets cinematic lighting. --ar 1:1 --v 6.1

### Detailed Prompt

**Composition:** A classic padlock shape occupies roughly 65% of the icon height, centered with a slight upward bias (visual center). The shackle is mid-opening — rotated ~15° from fully closed — creating a dramatic wedge-shaped gap. The lock body is wide and chunky, designed to feel substantial and iconic at small sizes.

**Lock body material:** Brushed dark metal (#27272A) with fine horizontal brushing texture visible under raking light. Edges catch a cool specular highlight (#3F3F46) suggesting hard-anodized aluminum. The overall tone is dark, premium, slightly industrial.

**Keyhole / microphone mesh:** The traditional keyhole shape is replaced by a circular microphone grille — a precise pattern of tiny perforated dots arranged in concentric rings, machined into the lock face. The mesh is recessed 1–2px, casting micro-shadows. At normal icon size (1024px) the mesh reads as a keyhole; at small sizes it reads as texture — intentional ambiguity.

**The light and sound escaping:** From the gap between shackle and lock body, warm amber-gold volumetric light spills outward. The light source gradient runs from deep amber (#D97706) at the crack to a brighter, more luminous gold (#F59E0B) in the halo. Riding on this glow are 2–3 hairline sound wave arcs in near-white gold (#FDE68A at 60% opacity), as if voice is physically escaping the lock.

**Background:** Pure deep black (#09090B), no gradient, no texture. The light bloom from the lock does all the atmospheric work.

**Mood:** Cinematic drama meets precision craftsmanship. Tells a story: voice unlocks. Warm, inviting, slightly theatrical.

**Midjourney:** `--ar 1:1 --style raw --stylize 400 --v 6.1`

**Keywords:** skeuomorphic padlock icon, brushed dark metal texture, volumetric amber glow, microphone mesh grille, sound wave ripples, cinematic light leak, macOS icon craftsmanship, voice unlock concept, keyhole microphone, dramatic product icon, warm gold light bloom
